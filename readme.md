## Design
### Color Scheme
The color scheme for this website is designed to be clean and simple, with a focus on readability.

- **Background Color**: The background is set to **white** (#FFFFFF) to provide a clean, minimalistic look, ensuring that the content remains the focal point.
- **Primary Color**: The main accents of the website are in **blue** and **light blue**. They are used for buttons and navigation bar, guiding the user’s attention and also matching the map color.
- **Text Color**: The primary font color is **black** (#000000) for optimal contrast against the white background, ensuring readability across all devices and environments.

This simple color scheme enhances the user experience by focusing on clarity, ease of navigation, and visual comfort.

### Typography
For the text styling of this website, the **Arial** font is chosen. Arial is a clean, sans-serif font known for its legibility and simplicity. It provides a modern and accessible reading experience, ensuring the content is easy to read for a wide range of users.

In the case that Arial is not available on the user's device, the fallback font is any available **sans-serif** font to maintain a clean, readable style.
